    Common cyber threats and attacks pose significant risks to individuals, organizations, and nations in today's digital landscape. Malicious actors continuously exploit vulnerabilities in technology and human behavior to compromise systems, steal sensitive information, and disrupt operations. Among the most prevalent threats are malware, including viruses, worms, and Trojans, which can infiltrate systems to steal data, disrupt operations, or extort money through ransomware attacks. Phishing attacks, on the other hand, employ deceptive tactics such as fraudulent emails or websites to trick users into disclosing sensitive information or downloading malicious software. Additionally, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks target websites and online services by overwhelming them with a flood of traffic, rendering them inaccessible to legitimate users. Other notable threats include insider threats, where trusted individuals abuse their access privileges to steal data or sabotage systems, and advanced persistent threats (APTs), sophisticated attacks typically orchestrated by nation-states or organized cybercriminal groups with specific objectives such as espionage or sabotage. Understanding these common cyber threats and attacks is essential for implementing effective security measures and mitigating risks in today's interconnected digital world.
