                Ahhh yes, a bridge with skyscraper background. Truly amazing how the skyscrapers
                are just majestically standing. Tall and ellegant, you can never get tired of looking at
                skyscrapers! Then the bridge an artistical masterpeice with great pillars holding it up
                like the thin legs of a chicken holding up it's massive body.
